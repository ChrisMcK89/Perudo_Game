# players 2 - 6
# last player with dice wins
# 6 colour cups
# 30 dice - 5 each colour
# make bids on the dice

# setup - highest role starts and each player takes cup and matching 5 dice

# round
# shake cup - produces random upwards facing number between 1 and 6 * how many dice the have left
# players can now look at what they have.
# auction starts and each player bids on how many dice of a specific value remaining in the game
# (1 counts as number auctioned and called a Paco - clockwise direction
# cannot start on 1

# player options
# outbid - more dice - eg. 8 4s can now bid 9 4s 
# outbid - higher value - eg. 8 5s 
# Paco auction - bet on number of Pacos - needs to be rounded up to at least half rounded up from the initial dice bet. eg(9/2 = 5 pacos)
# return to normal auction - needs to be double paco bid and add 1 eg 5 pacos will be 5 x 2 = 10 + 1 so bid of 11 threes
# announce bid is wrong
# DUDO!!! - announce that existing bid is wrong/to high. All players reveal die. if bid is too high then previous player loses
# if existing bid is correct then current player loses. Loser loses die.

# next round - player who lost die starts with first bid. If they have no die they are eliminated and player to left starts the bidding.

# Palifico - if player on last die and starting round. Pacos no longer wildcard and can not change value of the die. eg needs 
# to go 3 x 6, 4 x 6 etc. Player who starts can also bet on pacos as they are now normal values.

# winner is the remaining player with die
